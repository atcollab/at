\begin{DoxyVerb}find_orbit finds the closed orbit by numerically getting the fixed point
of the one turn map M calculated with lattice_pass.

Depending on the the lattice, find_orbit will:
- use find_orbit6 if ring.radiation is ON,
- use find_sync_orbit if ring.radiation is OFF and dct is specified,
- use find_orbit4 otherwise

PARAMETERS
    ring            Sequence of AT elements
    refpts          elements at which data is returned.

OUTPUT
    orbit0          ((6,) closed orbit vector at the entrance of the
                    1-st element
    orbit           (6, Nrefs) closed orbit vector at each location
                    specified in refpts

KEYWORDS
    dp=0            Momentum deviation, when radiation is OFF
    dct=0            Path lengthening, when radiation ids OFF
    keep_lattice    Assume no lattice change since the previous tracking.
                    Default: False
    guess=None      Initial guess for the closed orbit. It may help
                    convergence.

                    will then propagate it to the selected reference points

\begin{DoxyVerb}findorbit4 finds the closed orbit in the 4-d transverse phase
space by numerically solving for a fixed point of the one turn
map M calculated with lattice_pass.

    (X, PX, Y, PY, dP, CT2 ) = M (X, PX, Y, PY, dP, CT1)

under the CONSTANT MOMENTUM constraint dP and with NO constraint
on the 6-th coordinate CT

IMPORTANT!!! findorbit4 imposes a constraint on dP and relaxes
the constraint on the revolution frequency. A physical storage
ring does exactly the opposite: the momentum deviation of a
particle on the closed orbit settles at the value
such that the revolution is synchronous with the RF cavity

            HarmNumber*Frev = Frf

To impose this artificial constraint in find_orbit4, PassMethod
used for any element SHOULD NOT
1.  change the longitudinal momentum dP (cavities , magnets with radiation)
2.  have any time dependence (localized impedance, fast kickers etc)

PARAMETERS
    ring            lattice description (radiation must be OFF)
    dp              momentum deviation. Defaults to 0
    refpts          elements at which data is returned. It can be:
                    1) an integer in the range [-len(ring), len(ring)-1]
                       selecting the element according to python indexing
                       rules. As a special case, len(ring) is allowed and
                       refers to the end of the last element,
                    2) an ordered list of such integers without duplicates,
                    3) a numpy array of booleans of maximum length
                       len(ring)+1, where selected elements are True.
                    Defaults to None, if refpts is None an empty array is
                    returned for orbit.

OUTPUT
    orbit0          ((6,) closed orbit vector at the entrance of the
                    1-st element (x,px,y,py)
    orbit           (6, Nrefs) closed orbit vector at each location
                    specified in refpts

KEYWORDS
    dct=None        path lengthening. If specified, dp is ignored and
                    the off-momentum is deduced from the path lengthening.
    orbit=None      avoids looking for initial the closed orbit if is
                    already known ((6,) array). find_orbit4 propagates it
                    to the specified refpts.
    guess           (6,) initial value for the closed orbit. It may help
                    convergence. Default: (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
    keep_lattice    Assume no lattice change since the previous tracking.
                    Default: False
    convergence     Convergence criterion. Default: 1.e-12
    max_iterations  Maximum number of iterations. Default: 20
    XYStep          Step size. Default: DConstant.XYStep

\begin{DoxyVerb}find_orbit6 finds the closed orbit in the full 6-D phase space
by numerically solving  for a fixed point of the one turn
map M calculated with lattice_pass

(X, PX, Y, PY, DP, CT2 ) = M (X, PX, Y, PY, DP, CT1)

with constraint  CT2 - CT1 = C*HarmNumber(1/Frf - 1/Frf0)

IMPORTANT!!! find_orbit6 is a realistic simulation
1.  The Frf frequency in the RF cavities (may be different from Frf0)
    imposes the synchronous condition
    CT2 - CT1 = C*HarmNumber(1/Frf - 1/Frf0)
2.  The algorithm numerically calculates
    6-by-6 Jacobian matrix J6. In order for (J-E) matrix
    to be non-singular it is NECESSARY to use a realistic
    PassMethod for cavities with non-zero momentum kick
    (such as RFCavityPass).
3.  find_orbit6 can find orbits with radiation.
    In order for the solution to exist the cavity must supply
    adequate energy compensation.
    In the simplest case of a single cavity, it must have
    'Voltage' field set so that Voltage > Erad - energy loss per turn
4.  There is a family of solutions that correspond to different RF buckets
    They differ in the 6-th coordinate by C*Nb/Frf. Nb = 1 .. HarmNum-1
5.  The value of the 6-th coordinate found at the cavity gives
    the equilibrium RF phase. If there is no radiation the phase is 0;

PARAMETERS
    ring            lattice description (radiation must be ON)
    refpts          elements at which data is returned. It can be:
                    1) an integer in the range [-len(ring), len(ring)-1]

                       len(ring)+1, where selected elements are True.
                    Defaults to None, if refpts is None an empty array is
                    returned for orbit.

OUTPUT
    orbit0          ((6,) closed orbit vector at the entrance of the
                    1-st element (x,px,y,py)

and momentum deviation dP (first 5 components of the phase space vector)
% by numerically solving  for a fixed point
% of the one turn map M calculated with lattice_pass

    (X, PX, Y, PY, dP, CT2 ) = M (X, PX, Y, PY, dP, CT1)

under the constraint dCT = CT2 - CT1 = C/Frev - C/Frev0, where
Frev0 = Frf0/HarmNumber is the design revolution frequency
Frev  = (Frf0 + dFrf)/HarmNumber is the imposed revolution frequency

IMPORTANT!!!  find_sync_orbit imposes a constraint (CT2 - CT1) and
dP2 = dP1 but no constraint on the value of dP1, dP2
The algorithm assumes time-independent fixed-momentum ring
to reduce the dimensionality of the problem.

To impose this artificial constraint in find_sync_orbit
PassMethod used for any element SHOULD NOT
1.  change the longitudinal momentum dP (cavities , magnets with radiation)
2.  have any time dependence (localized impedance, fast kickers etc).
