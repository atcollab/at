title: Controlling the RF cavities
---
A lattice may contain multiple RF cavities, grouped according to different RF systems:
main cavities, harmonic cavitiesâ€¦\
AT provides simple tools to tune them, with methods and properties of the
`Lattice` object.

### Lattice methods for cavity control

All methods have `array` and `cavpts` keyword arguments, used to select the cavities concerned by the command.

- if `array is True`, the output attribute value is an array as long as the number of selected cavities.
  The input argument must be an array as long as the number of selected cavities
  or a scalar which will be broadcasted to the number of cavities,
- if `array is False` (default), the input and output are scalars. The scalar value
applies to the set of cavities with the lowest frequency within the selection.
The other cavities are ignored in `get_*` methods. For `set_*` methods, the other
cavities are scaled as explained if the specific method description.

The `cavpts` argument is used as follows:
- `cavpts` is a "refpts" type (integer, integer or boolean array, callable): it is used to select the
  cavities.
- `cavpts is None` (default value), and the `Lattice` object has a `cavpts` attribute:
  the lattice attribute is used to select the cavities.
- `cavpts is None`, and the lattice has no `cavpts` attribute (or it is `None`):
  all cavities are taken into account.

- **single RF system:** you can forget the `cavpts` argument: by default the methods
address all cavities. However, using the `Lattice.cavpts` attribute makes calls significantly
faster by skipping the search for cavities.<br/>
- **complex system:** an easy way is to have the `Lattice.cavpts` address the accelerating
cavities so that they will be driven by default. Harmonic cavities may be driven
using the `cavpts` argument.

Adding to the Lattice \"refpts\" type attributes addressing the different cavity sets make
them available everywhere the lattice is visible.

All `set_*` methods also have a `copy` argument to select either in-place modification
of the lattice, or creation of a shallow copy with modified cavities.

#### Voltage:
```voltage = Lattice.get_rf_voltage(cavpts=None, array=False)```

The scalar voltage is the sum of the cavity voltages of the cavities with the
lowest frequency within the selection, multiplied by the periodicity.

```Lattice.set_rf_voltage(voltage, cavpts=None, array=False, copy=False)```

For array == False, all the existing voltages are scaled to reach the specified
value on the fundamental mode.

#### Frequency:
`frequency = Lattice.get_rf_frequency(cavpts=None, array=False)`

The frequency of the fundamental mode is returned.

`Lattice.get_rf_frequency(frequency=None, dp=None, dct=None, cavpts=None, array=False, copy=False)`

If the frequency is None, the method will set the frequency to the nominal value,
according to the revolution frequency and harmonic number. An optional
off-momentum may be applied using the `dp` or `dct` arguments. The frequency
shift is then computed using the linear slip factor $$\eta_c = 1/\gamma^2 - \alpha_c$$ ,
so that the resulting `dp` may slightly differ from the specified value.

For array == False, the value is applied to the fundamental mode cavities and
the frequency of all other cavities is scaled by the same ratio.

#### Time lag
The time lag is expressed in values of path lengthening "c&tau;", the 6<sup>th</sup> particle coordinate [m].

`time_lag = Lattice.get_rf_timelag(cavpts=None, array=False)`

The time lag of the fundamental mode is returned.

`Lattice.set_rf_timelag(time_lag, cavpts=None, array=False, copy=False)`

For array == False, the time lag is applied to the fundamental mode cavities and
the time lag of all the other selected cavities is shifted by the same amount.

#### All-in-one method
`Lattice.set_cavity(ring, Voltage=None, Frequency=None, TimeLag=None,
                    cavpts=None, array=False, copy=False)`

This method sets only the explicitly provided values, the other ones are left unchanged.
For the frequency, a special value `at.Frf.NOMINAL` means nominal frequency,
according to the revolution frequency and harmonic number.

The behaviour of the `cavpts` and `array` keywords is the same as for individual methods.

### Lattice properties
The properties provide an even easier way to control the cavities, but are restricted
to the default behaviour of the equivalent Lattice method:
- cavities are selected by the `Lattice.cavpts` attribute (all cavities by default),
- Setting a property modifies the ring in-place (no copy).

`Lattice.rf_voltage`

`Lattice.rf_frequency`

The special value `at.Frf.NOMINAL` means nominal frequency.

`Lattice.harmonic_number`

`Lattice.time_lag`
