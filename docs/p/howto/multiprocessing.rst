.. _parallel:

Parallel processing
===================

In most passmethods, particles are independent. So multi-particle tracking is
well adapted for parallel processing. But a few elements, like impedance elements,
need the knowledge of the whole particle distribution. These are subclasses of
the :py:class:`.Collective` class. Depending on the multiprocessing option
chosen, they must be excluded from parallel tracking or be protected by a fence.

PyAT has several options for parallel computing. Though nothing wrong should
happen when simultaneously activating several options, it is usually advised
not to do so.

Python :py:obj:`multiprocessing` package
----------------------------------------
Some PyAT functions are based on the standard Python :obj:`multiprocessing`
package.

* Always available, on all platforms, with the default installation,
* Must be explicitly called, either by calling :py:func:`.patpass` instead
  of :py:func:`.lattice_pass` for tracking, or by specifying a ``use_mp``
  boolean keyword argument in some functions (see :py:func:`.get_acceptance` for
  example).
* :py:class:`.Collective` element classes are not allowed.

`OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org>`_
----------------------------------
PyAT C integrators can be compiled with `OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org>`_.
Parallelism is activated inside each integrator, when possible.

* Available on all platforms with a special installation procedure,
* Fully transparent once installed: `OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org>`_ is
  automatically activated when tracking more than ``OMP_PARTICLE_THRESHOLD``
  particles (10 by default). As a consequence, many internal PyAT functions
  (closed orbit, transfer matricesâ€¦) benefit from parallelism,
* No restriction on element classes,
* Uses shared-memory multiprocessing: small overhead, but limited to
  single-node multicore machines,

Installation
............
`OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org>`_ is integrated in most modern compilers and
does not require any preliminary installation, except for macOS:

.. admonition:: macOS preliminary OpenMP installation

   While the ``clang`` compiler integrates `OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org>`_,
   ``libomp.dylib`` must be installed with your favorite package manager,
   `Homebrew <https://brew.sh>`_ or `MacPorts <https://www.macports.org>`_:

   | Use ``$ brew install libomp``
   | or  ``$ sudo port install libomp``

From the PyPI repository, you must install from source (disable the binary
distribution)::

    pip install --no-binary accelerator-toolbox --config-settings openmp=1 accelerator-toolbox


From a local clone: when switching from a standard install
to an `OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org>`_ one or vice-versa, remove the
``build`` directory to force a re-compilation::

    cd <at>
    rm -rf build
    pip install --config-settings openmp=1 .

Configuration
.............
The minimum number of particles triggering parallelism can be configured at
compile time either by setting a ``OMP_PARTICLE_THRESHOLD`` environment variable
or by specifying the ``omp_particle_threshold`` configuration option::

    OPENMP=1 OMP_PARTICLE_THRESHOLD=4 pip install . # or
    pip install --config-settings openmp=1 --config-settings omp_particle_threshold=4 .

The number of threads is by default automatically selected by
`OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org>`_. It can be forced to any value with the
``omp_num_threads`` keyword argument of :py:func:`.lattice_pass`

`MPI <https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/>`_
----------------------------------------
PyAT can be installed with `MPI <https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/>`_
compatibility.

* Available on all platforms with a special installation procedure, but mostly
  interesting on computer clusters,
* Message-passing interface implies a significant overhead for data transfer,
  but allows large scale and heterogeneous computer infrastructures,
* No restriction on element classes,
* The whole python session needs to be started with ``mpirun``: better suited
  for massive multi-particle batch jobs than for interactive sessions,

Installation
............
`MPI <https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/>`_ must be preliminary installed on the
computer.

From the PyPI repository, you must install from source (disable the binary
distribution)::

    pip install --no-binary accelerator-toolbox --config-settings mpi=1 "accelerator-toolbox[mpi]"

Installing PyAT from a local clone: when switching from a standard install
to a `MPI <https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/>`_ one or vice-versa, remove the
``build`` directory to force a re-compilation::

    cd <at>
    rm -rf build
    pip install --config-settings mpi=1 ".[mpi]"
