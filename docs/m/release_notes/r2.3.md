# 2.3
## Main changes
-  **`atlinopt6`** replaces **`atlinopt`** in some optics function: **`atplot`**, **`atfittun`**, **`atfitchro``**,…This allows working with 6D lattices. However there are still many functions still using `atlinopt`. The transition will be continued, 
-  2 new functions **`atGetRingProperties`** and **`atSetRingProperties`** handle global lattices parameters (energy, periodicity, particle, harmonic number). They are stored in the optional RingParam lattice element. Its use is now recommended since it avoids lengthy searches when a parameter is requested, 
-  A new function **`atloadlattice`** makes reading lattice files easier, 
-  The default passmethod for cavities is now **`RFCavityPass`** instead of CavityPass. CavityPass is still available but should not be used: it is wrong for multi\-tune tracking if the RF frequency is not the nominal one.
