# 2.5
## Main changes
-  A new keyword `df` is introduced to specify to specify off\-momentum computation, in addition to `dp` and `dct`. It is available in `atsetcavity`, `findorbit`\*, `findm44`, `atlinopt`\*, `tunechrom`, 
-  Dipole radiation tapering  can be set using attapering. 
-  A set of new "exact" integrators is introduced: ``ExactDriftPass``, ``ExactMultipolePass``, ``ExactSectorBendPass``, ``ExactRectangularBendPass``. 
-  A new computation of Resonance Driving Terms (RDT), in pure Matlab, is introduced in `computeRDTfluctuations`. The sign convention is opposite to the one in `computeRDT`. 
-  The physical constants used in the C integrators have been updated to the  [CODATA 2018](https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/) values. The values used in Matlab are already up\-to\-date.
