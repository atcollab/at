# 2.7
## Main changes
-  GPU tracking is now implemented, thanks to [@JeanLucPons](https://github.com/JeanLucPons), 
-  Physical constants are updated to CODADA 2022. This may cause slight changes in the results, 
-  The computation of diffusion matrices is now modular and is integrated in the C integrators, 
-  The seed of random generators can now be set at the beginning of tracking, as an argument of `ringpass` and `linepass.`
