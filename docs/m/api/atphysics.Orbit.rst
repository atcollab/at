.. py:function:: findorbit(ring,refpts)

   | find the closed orbit
   
   | Depending on the lattice, **findorbit** will:
   |  - use findorbit6 if radiation is ON,
   |  - use findsyncorbit if radiation is OFF and ct is specified,
   |  - use findorbit4 otherwise
   
   | **[orbit,fixedpoint]=findorbit(ring,refpts)**
   
   |  ORBIT:        6xNrefs, closed orbit at the selected reference points
   |  FIXEDPOINT:   6x1 closed orbit at the entrance of the lattice
   
   | **[...]=findorbit(ring,...,'dp',dp)** Specify the momentum deviation when
   |    radiation is OFF (default: 0)
   
   | **[...]=findorbit(ring,...,'dct',dct)** Specify the path lengthening when
   |    radiation is OFF (default: 0)
   
   | **[...]=findorbit(ring,...,'df',df)** Specify the RF frequency deviation
   |    radiation is OFF (default: 0)
   
   | **[...]=findorbit(ring,...,'orbit',orbit)** Specify the orbit at the entrance
   |    of the ring, if known. **findorbit** will then transfer it to the reference points
   
   | **[...]=findorbit(ring,...,'guess',guess)** The search will start with GUESS as
   |    initial conditions

.. py:function:: findorbit4(ring)

   | finds closed orbit in the 4-d transverse phase
   |  space by numerically solving  for a fixed point of the one turn
   |  map M calculated with LINEPASS
   
   |          (X, PX, Y, PY, dP2, CT2 ) = M (X, PX, Y, PY, dP1, CT1)
   
   |     under the CONSTANT MOMENTUM constraint, dP2 = dP1 = dP and
   |     there is NO constraint on the 6-th coordinate CT
   
   |  IMPORTANT !!!
   |  **findorbit4** gives a wrong result with 6-d rings. If you still want to
   |     get the result, set 'strict' to -1 or 0.
   |  **findorbit4** imposes a constraint on dP and relaxes
   |     the constraint on the revolution frequency. A physical storage
   |     ring does exactly the opposite: the momentum deviation of a
   |     particle on the closed orbit settles at the value
   |     such that the revolution is synchronous with the RF cavity
   
   |                  HarmNumber*Frev = Frf
   
   |     To impose this artificial constraint in **findorbit4**
   |     PassMethod used for any elemen SHOULD NOT
   |     1. change the longitudinal momentum dP (cavities , magnets with radiation)
   |     2. have any time dependence (localized impedance, fast kickers etc)
   
   | **findorbit4(ring)** is 4x1 vector - fixed point at the
   |     entrance of the 1-st element of the RING (x,px,y,py)
   
   | **findorbit4(ring,refpts) is 4xlength(refpts)**
   |    array of column vectors - fixed points (x,px,y,py)
   |    at the entrance of each element indexed by the REFPTS array.
   |    REFPTS is an array of increasing indexes that  select elements
   |    from the range 1 to length(RING)+1.
   |    See further explanation of REFPTS in the 'help' for FINDSPOS
   
   | **findorbit4(ring,dp,refpts,...)** Obsolete syntax
   | **findorbit4(ring, ...,'strict',strict)** Default: 0.
   |    If STRICT is -1, check_6d is skipped
   |    If STRICT is  0, check_6d emits a warning for non-6d rings.
   |    If STRICT is  1, check_6d emits an error for non-6d rings.
   
   | **findorbit4(ring,...,'dp',dp)**   Specifies the off-momentum
   
   | **findorbit4(ring,...,'dct',dct)** Specifies the path lengthening
   
   | **findorbit4(ring,...,'df',df)** Specifies RF frequency deviation
   
   | **findorbit4(ring,dp,refpts,guess)**
   | **findorbit4(...,'guess',guess)**     The search for the fixed point
   |    starts from initial condition GUESS. Otherwise the search starts from
   |    [0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0]. GUESS must be a 6x1 vector.
   
   | **findorbit4(...,'orbit',orbit)**     Specify the orbit at the entrance
   |    of the ring, if known. **findorbit4** will then transfer it to the
   |    reference points. ORBIT must be a 6x1 vector.
   
   | **[orbit, fixedpoint] = findorbit4( ... )**
   | 	The optional second return parameter is a 6x1 vector:
   |    closed orbit at the entrance of the RING.

.. py:function:: findorbit6(ring,refpts,guess)

   | finds closed orbit in the full 6-d phase space
   |  by numerically solving  for a fixed point of the one turn
   |  map M calculated with RINGPASS
   
   |  (X, PX, Y, PY, DP, CT2 ) = M (X, PX, Y, PY, DP, CT1)
   
   |  with constraint % CT2 - CT1 = C*HarmNumber(1/Frf - 1/Frf0)
   
   |  IMPORTANT!!! **findorbit6** is a realistic simulation
   |  1. The Frf frequency in the RF cavities (may be different from Frf0)
   |     imposes the synchronous condition
   |     CT2 - CT1 = C*HarmNumber(1/Frf - 1/Frf0)
   |  2. The algorithm numerically calculates
   |     6-by-6 Jacobian matrix J6. In order for (J-E) matrix
   |     to be non-singular it is NECESSARY to use a realistic
   |     PassMethod for cavities with non-zero momentum kick
   |     (such as RFCavityPass).
   |  3. **findorbit6** can find orbits with radiation.
   |     In order for the solution to exist the cavity must supply
   |     adequate energy compensation.
   |     In the simplest case of a single cavity, it must have
   |     'Voltage' field set so that Voltage > Erad - energy loss per turn
   |  4. **findorbit6** starts the search from [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]', unless
   |     the third argument is specified: **findorbit6(ring,refpts,guess)**
   |     There exist a family of solutions that correspond to different RF buckets
   |     They differ in the 6-th coordinate by C*Nb/Frf. Nb = 1 .. HarmNum-1
   |  5. The value of the 6-th coordinate found at the cavity gives
   |     the equilibrium RF phase. If there is no radiation the phase is 0;
   
   |  **findorbit6(ring)** is 6x1 vector - fixed point at the
   | 		entrance of the 1-st element of the RING (x,px,y,py,dp,ct)
   
   |  **findorbit6(ring,refpts) is 6xlength(refpts)**
   |    array of column vectors - fixed points (x,px,y,py,dp,ct)
   |    at the entrance of each element indexed by the REFPTS array.
   |    REFPTS is an array of increasing indexes that  select elements
   |    from the range 1 to length(RING)+1.
   |    See further explanation of REFPTS in the 'help' for FINDSPOS
   
   |  **findorbit6(...,'dp',dp)**
   |    Specify the off-momentum. The RF frequency will be adjusted to get the
   |    desired value
   
   |  **findorbit6(...,'dct',dct)**
   |    Specify the path lengthening. The RF frequency will be adjusted to get
   |    the desired value
   
   |  **findorbit6(...,'df',df)**
   |    Specify the RF frequency deviation
   
   |  **findorbit6(ring,refpts,guess)**
   |  **findorbit6(...,'guess',guess)**     The search for the fixed point
   | 	starts from initial condition GUESS. Otherwise the search starts from
   |    the synchronous phase. GUESS must be a 6x1 vector.
   
   |  **findorbit6(...,'orbit',orbit)**     Specify the orbit at the entrance
   |    of the ring, if known. **findorbit6** will then transfer it to the
   |    reference points. ORBIT must be a 6x1 vector.
   
   |  **[orbit, fixedpoint] = findorbit6( ... )**
   | 	The optional second return parameter is a 6x1 vector:
   |    closed orbit at the entrance of the RING.
   
   | See also :func:`findorbit4`, :func:`findsyncorbit`

.. py:function:: findsyncorbit(ring)

   | finds closed orbit, synchronous with the RF cavity
   |  and momentum deviation dP (first 5 components of the phase space vector)
   |  by numerically solving  for a fixed point
   |  of the one turn map M calculated with LINEPASS
   
   |        (X, PX, Y, PY, dP2, CT2 ) = M (X, PX, Y, PY, dP1, CT1)
   
   |     under constraints CT2 - CT1 =  dCT = C(1/Frev - 1/Frev0) and dP2 = dP1 , where
   |     Frev0 = Frf0/HarmNumber is the design revolution frequency
   |     Frev  = (Frf0 + dFrf)/HarmNumber is the imposed revolution frequency
   
   |  IMPORTANT!!!
   |  **findsyncorbit** gives a wrong result with 6-d rings. If you still want to
   |     get the result, set 'strict' to -1 or 0.
   |  **findsyncorbit** imposes a constraint (CT2 - CT1) and
   |     dP2 = dP1 but no constraint on the value of dP1, dP2
   |     The algorithm assumes time-independent fixed-momentum ring
   |     to reduce the dimensionality of the problem.
   |     To impose this artificial constraint in **findsyncorbit**
   |     PassMethod used for any element SHOULD NOT
   |     1. change the longitudinal momentum dP (cavities , magnets with radiation)
   |     2. have any time dependence (localized impedance, fast kickers etc).
   
   
   |  **findsyncorbit(ring)** is 5x1 vector - fixed point at the
   | 		entrance of the 1-st element of the RING (x,px,y,py,dP)
   
   |  **findsyncorbit(ring,refpts) is 5xlength(refpts)**
   |    array of column vectors - fixed points (x,px,y,py,dP)
   |    at the entrance of each element indexed by the REFPTS array.
   |    REFPTS is an array of increasing indexes that  select elements
   |    from the range 1 to length(RING)+1.
   |    See further explanation of REFPTS in the 'help' for FINDSPOS
   |  **findsyncorbit(ring, ...,'strict',strict)** Default: 0.
   |    If STRICT is -1, check_6d is skipped
   |    If STRICT is  0, check_6d emits a warning for non-6d rings.
   |    If STRICT is  1, check_6d emits an error for non-6d rings.
   
   | See also :func:`findsyncorbit`, :func:`findorbit6`, :func:`atdisable_6d`, :func:`check_6d`

.. py:function:: plotcod(ring,dp)

   | Closed Orbit Distortion
   |  **plotcod(ring,dp)** finds and plots closed orbit for a given momentum
   |   deviation DP. It calls FINDORBIT4 which assumes a lattice
   |   with NO accelerating cavities and NO radiation
