   | inv(A)*T*A=[ 0   Rotz  0  ]
   |            [ 0    0   Rots]
   
   | Order it so that it is close to the order of x,y,z
   | also ensure that positive modes are before negative so that
   | one has proper symplecticity
   | B. Nash July 18, 2013
   | we order and normalize the vectors via
   |  v_j' jmat(3) v_k = i sgn(j) delta(j,k)

.. py:function:: atdampingrates(m66)

   | find tunes and damping rates from one map matrix with radiation
   
   | **[nu,chi]=atdampingrates(m66)**
   
   | note that in order to find the damping times, one needs the revolution
   | time T0, then
   | tau1 = T0/chi1, tau2 = T0/chi2, tau3 = T0/chi3

.. py:function:: atlinopt(ring,dp,refpts)

   | Performs 4D linear analysis of the COUPLED lattices
   
   | **atlinopt** only works for CONSTANT energy. So no PassMethod should:
   |    1. change the longitudinal momentum dP (cavities, magnets with radiation)
   |    2. have any time dependence (localized impedance, fast kickers etc)
   
   | For a more general computation, see ATLINOPT6
   
   |  **lindata = atlinopt(ring,dp,refpts)** is a MATLAB structure array with fields
   
   |    ElemIndex   - ordinal position in the RING
   |    SPos        - longitudinal position [m]
   |    ClosedOrbit - 4x1 closed orbit vector with components
   |                  x, px, y, py (momentums, NOT angles)

   |    B           - 2x2 matrix B in [3]
   |    C           - 2x2 matrix C in [3]
   |    gamma       - gamma parameter of the transformation to eigenmodes
   |    mu          - [mux, muy] horizontal and vertical betatron phase advances
   |    beta        - [betax, betay] vector
   |    alpha       - [alphax, alphay] vector
   
   |    All values are specified at the entrance of each element specified in REFPTS.
   |    REFPTS is an array of increasing indexes that  select elements
   |    from the range 1 to length(LINE)+1. Defaults to 1 (initial point)
   |    See further explanation of REFPTS in the 'help' for FINDSPOS
   
   |  **[lindata,nu] = atlinopt()** returns a vector of linear tunes
   |    [nu_u , nu_v] for two normal modes of linear motion [1]
   
   |  **[lindata,nu, ksi] = atlinopt() returns a vector of chromaticities ksi = d(nu)/(dp/p)**
   |    [ksi_u , ksi_v] - derivatives of [nu_u , nu_v]
   
   |  **[...] = atlinopt(...,'orbit',orbitin)**
   |  **[...] = atlinopt(ring,dp,refpts,orbitin)  (deprecated syntax)**
   |    Do not search for closed orbit. Instead ORBITIN,a 6x1 vector
   |    of initial conditions is used: [x0; px0; y0; py0; DP; 0].
   |    The sixth component is ignored.
   |    This syntax is useful to specify the entrance orbit if RING is not a
   |    ring or to avoid recomputing the closed orbit if is already known.
   
   |  **[...] = atlinopt(...,'coupled',flag)**
   |    If flag is false, a faster computation is performed
   |    assuming no coupling in the lattice. Default: true
   
   |  **[...] = atlinopt(...,'ct',ct)**
   |    Instead of computing the linear optics for  the specified DP/P,
   |    computes for the path lenghening specified by CT.
   |    The DP argument is ignored.
   
   |  **[...] = atlinopt(...,'twiss_in',twissin)**
   |    Computes the optics for a transfer line.
   
   |  TWISSIN is a scalar structure with fields:
   |    ClosedOrbit - 4x1 initial closed orbit. Default: zeros(4,1)
   |    Dispersion  - 4x1 initial dispersion.   Default: zeros(4,1)
   |    mu          - [ mux, muy] horizontal and vertical betatron phase
   |    beta        - [betax0, betay0] vector

   | 			  Phase advance output
   | 			  Option to skip closed orbit search

.. py:function:: findm44(lattice)

   | numerically finds the 4x4 transfer matrix of an accelerator lattice
   |  for a particle with relative momentum deviation DP
   
   |  IMPORTANT!!!
   |  **findm44** gives a wrong result with 6-d rings.
   |  **findm44** assumes constant momentum deviation.
   |    PassMethod used for any element in the LATTICE SHOULD NOT
   |    1.change the longitudinal momentum dP
   |      (cavities , magnets with radiation, ...)
   |    2.have any time dependence (localized impedance, fast kickers, ...)
   
   |  **m44 = findm44(lattice)** finds the full one-turn
   |     matrix at the entrance of the first element
   |     !!! With this syntax **findm44** assumes that the LATTICE
   |     is a ring and first finds the closed orbit
   
   |  **[m44,t] = findm44(lattice,refpts)** also returns
   |     4x4 transfer matrixes  between entrance of
   |     the first element and each element indexed by REFPTS.
   |     T is 4x4xlength(REFPTS) 3 dimensional array
   |     so that the set of indexes (:,:,i) selects the 4-by-4
   |     matrix at the i-th reference point.
   
   |     Note: REFPTS is an array of increasing indexes that
   |     select elements from range 1 to length(LATTICE)+1.
   |     See further explanation of REFPTS in the 'help' for FINDSPOS
   |     When REFPTS= [ 1 2 .. ] the fist point is the entrance of the
   |     first element and T(:,:,1) - identity matrix
   
   |     Note: REFPTS is allowed to go 1 point beyond the
   |     number of elements. In this case the last point is
   |     the EXIT of the last element. If LATTICE is a RING
   |     it is also the entrance of the first element
   |     after 1 turn: T(:,:,end) = M
   
   |  **[...] = findm44(ring,...,'dp',dp)**
   |  **[...] = findm44(ring,dp,refpts,...)  (deprecated syntax)**
   |    Computes for the off-momentum DP
   
   |  **[...] = findm44(ring,...,'dct',dct)**
   |    Computes for the path lenghening specified by CT.
   
   |  **[...] = findm44(ring,...,'df',df)**
   |    Computes for a deviation of RF frequency DF
   
   |  **[...] = findm44(ring,...,'orbit',orbitin)**
   |  **[...] = findm44(ring,dp,refpts,orbitin)  (deprecated syntax)**
   |    Do not search for closed orbit. Instead ORBITIN,a 6x1 vector
   |    of initial conditions is used: [x0; px0; y0; py0; DP; 0].
   |    The sixth component is ignored.
   |    This syntax is useful to specify the entrance orbit if RING is not a
   |    ring or to avoid recomputing the closed orbit if is already known.
   
   |  **[...] = findm44(...,'full')**
   |    Same as above except that matrices returned in T are full 1-turn
   |    matrices at the entrance of each element indexed by REFPTS.
   
   |  **[m44,t,orbit] = findm44(...)**
   |    In addition returns the closed orbit at the entrance of each element
   |    indexed by REFPTS.

.. py:function:: findm66(ring)

   | numerically finds the 6x6 transfer matrix of an accelerator lattice
   |   by differentiation of LINEPASS near the closed orbit
   |   **findm66** uses FINDORBIT6 to search for the closed orbit in 6-d
   |   In order for this to work the ring MUST have a CAVITY element
   
   |  **m66 = findm66(ring)** finds the full one-turn 6-by-6
   |     matrix at the entrance of the first element
   
   | **[...]=findm66(ring,...,'dp',dp)** Specify the momentum deviation when

   |    of the ring, if known.
   
   |  **[m66,t] = findm66(ring,refpts)** in addition to M finds
   |     6-by-6 transfer matrixes  between entrances of
   |     the first element and each element indexed by REFPTS.
   |     T is 6-by-6-by-length(REFPTS) 3 dimentional array.
   
   |     REFPTS is an array of increasing indexes that  select elements
   |     from the range 1 to length(RING)+1.
   |     See further explanation of REFPTS in the 'help' for FINDSPOS
   
   |     Note:
   |     When REFPTS= [ 1 2 .. ] the first point is the entrance of the first element
   |     and T(:,:,1) - identity matrix
   |     When REFPTS= [  .. length(RING)+1] the last point is the exit of the last element
   |     and the entrance of the first element after 1 turn: T(:,:, ) = M
   
   |  **[...] = findm66(ring,refpts,orbitin)    (deprecated syntax)**
   |  **[...] = findm66(...,'orbit',orbitin)**
   |    Do not search for closed orbit. This syntax is useful to avoid
   |    recomputing the closed orbit if it is already known.
