# "Small angle" Passmethods

The "Small angle" passmethods use a linearised approximation of the longitudinal
momentum:
```{math}

p_z=1+\delta
```
resulting in:
```{math}

x' &= \frac{p_x}{1+\delta} \\ y' &= \frac{p_y}{1+\delta}
```
These methods are fast and are assigned by default when creating AT elements.

```

## `IdentityPass`
Thin element with no effect. However, the element may define transverse apertures
limiting the physical aperture,

## `DriftPass`
Field-free space in the small angle approximation.

Length
: Drift length.

## `RFCavityPass`
RF Cavity

Length
: Cavity length. If `Length` is non-zero, a drift of half-length is added on each
side of a thin cavity.

Voltage
: Cavity voltage

Frequency
: Cavity frequency

TimeLag
: Time lag expressed as path lengthening: {math}`\beta c \tau`.

PhaseLag
: Phase lag in radians. `TimeLag` and `PhaseLag` are accumulated as:
  
  ```{math}
  \mathbf{PhaseLag} - 2 \pi f_{RF} \frac{\mathbf{TimeLag}}{\beta c}
  ```
