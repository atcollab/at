## Introduction

Accelerator Toolbox (AT) is a collection of tools to model storage rings and beam transport lines in Matlab.

With AT it is possible to:

- **create and manipulate accelerator lattice elements**, which are stored in Matlab structures
- **track particles through the lattice**, selecting the appropriate integrator to represent the physics
- **compute accelerator parameters and beam properties**, generating new scripts or taking advantage of the existing ones

Examples of things AT enables are: create a lattice structure that links to the integrators, and then to track through the lattice 
including non-linear elements, analyze the non-linear motion, change settings to affect parameters, compute equilibrium beam sizes 
with radiation, and so on.
