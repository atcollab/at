'''
This is an example of a python passmethod, here the Identity
passmethod.
The python passmethods has to be in the python path and contain
a function trackFunction, the element creation is as follows:

params = {'Length':0,
          'PassMethod':'pyIdentityPass',
          }         

ib_elem = Element('py_id',**params)

To be noted:
The particles are described by a one dimensional vector
6*num_particles in the C tracking engine.
In case a pyhton passmethod and a c passmethod with the same name
are found, the c passmethod is used
'''

_id = numpy.identity(6)

def trackFunction(rin,elem=None):
    for i in range(0,len(rin),6):
        rin[i:i+6] = numpy.dot(_id, rin[i:i+6])
    return rin
