    IMPORTANT!!! find_m44 assumes constant momentum deviation.
    PassMethod used for any element in the lattice SHOULD NOT
    1.  change the longitudinal momentum dP
        (cavities , magnets with radiation, ...)
    2.  have any time dependence (localized impedance, fast kickers, ...)

                           len(ring)+1, where selected elements are True.

    KEYWORDS
