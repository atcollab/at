    with constraint  CT2 - CT1 = C*HarmNumber(1/Frf - 1/Frf0)

    IMPORTANT!!! find_orbit6 is a realistic simulation
    1.  The Frf frequency in the RF cavities (may be different from Frf0)
        imposes the synchronous condition
        CT2 - CT1 = C*HarmNumber(1/Frf - 1/Frf0)
    2.  The algorithm numerically calculates
        6-by-6 Jacobian matrix J6. In order for (J-E) matrix
        to be non-singular it is NECESSARY to use a realistic
        PassMethod for cavities with non-zero momentum kick
        (such as ThinCavityPass).
    3.  find_orbit6 can find orbits with radiation.
        In order for the solution to exist the cavity must supply
        adequate energy compensation.
        In the simplest case of a single cavity, it must have
        'Voltage' field set so that Voltage > Erad - energy loss per turn
    4.  find_orbit6 starts the search from [0,,0, 0, 0, 0, 0], unless
        the third argument is specified: find_orbit6(ring,...,guess=initial_orbit)
        There exist a family of solutions that correspond to different RF buckets
        They differ in the 6-th coordinate by C*Nb/Frf. Nb = 1 .. HarmNum-1
    5.  The value of the 6-th coordinate found at the cavity gives
        the equilibrium RF phase. If there is no radiation the phase is 0;
