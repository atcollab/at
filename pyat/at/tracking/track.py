    calling the element-specific tracking function specified in the
    lattice[i].PassMethod field.

    Note:

     * lattice_pass(lattice, r_in, refpts=len(line)) is the same as
       lattice_pass(lattice, r_in) since the reference point len(line) is the
       exit of the last element
     * lattice_pass(lattice, r_in, refpts=0) is a copy of r_in since the
       reference point 0 is the entrance of the first element

    PARAMETERS
        lattice:    iterable of AT elements
        r_in:       (6, N) array: input coordinates of N particles.
                    r_in is modified in-place and reports the coordinates at
                    the end of the tracking. For the the best efficiency, r_in
                    should be given as F_CONTIGUOUS numpy array.
        nturns:     number of passes through the lattice line
        refpts      elements at which data is returned. It can be:
                    1) an integer in the range [-len(ring), len(ring)-1]
                       selecting the element according to python indexing
                       rules. As a special case, len(ring) is allowed and
                       refers to the end of the last element,
                    2) an ordered list of such integers without duplicates,
                    3) a numpy array of booleans of maximum length
                       len(ring)+1, where selected elements are True.
                    Defaults to None, meaning no refpts, equivelent to
                    passing an empty array for calculation purposes.
        keep_lattice: use elements persisted from a previous call to at.atpass.
                    If True, assume that the lattice has not changed since
                    that previous call.
        losses:     Boolean to activate loss maps output, default is False

    OUTPUT
        (6, N, R, T) array containing output coordinates of N particles
        at R reference points for T turns.
        If losses ==True: {islost,turn,elem,coord} dictionnary containing
        flag for particles lost (True -> particle lost), turn, element and
        coordinates at which the particle is lost. Set to zero for particles
        that survived
