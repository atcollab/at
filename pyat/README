pyAT
====


pyAT is a Python interface to the pass methods defined in AT.


Installation (Linux only)
-------------------------

This is subject to change as we aim for a cross-platform build mechanism.

First, build shared object (.so) files for the pass methods in the
atintegrators directory using the Makefile.

Then, build the Python extension.  It is easiest to do this using a virtualenv:

* virtualenv --no-site-packages venv
* source venv/bin/activate
* pip install numpy
* pip install pytest
* python setup.py build
* python setup.py install --prefix=prefix

This should build the extension into the subdirectory prefix.

Now you need to set up the PYTHONPATH:

* export PYTHONPATH=./prefix/lib/python2.7/site-packages:.

Finally, you should be able to run the tests:

* py.test test
