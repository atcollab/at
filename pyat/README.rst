pyAT

Introduction
------------

Accelerator Toolbox is a code used for simulating particle accelerators, used
particularly for synchrotron light sources. It is hosted on `Github
<https://github.com/atcollab>`_. Its original implementation is in Matlab.

pyAT is a Python interface to Accelerator Toolbox. It uses the 'pass methods'
defined in Accelerator Toolbox, implemented by compiling the C code used in the
AT 'integrators' into a Python extension. These pass methods are used by
higher-level functions to provide physics results.

pyAT supports Python 2.7 (deprecated) and 3.5 to 3.8.

Installation
------------

Install accelerator-toolbox from PyPI::

    pip install accelerator-toolbox

Usage
-----

Example usage::

    >>> from at.load import loadmat
    >>> from at.physics import linopt
    >>> ring = load_mat('test_matlab/hmba.mat')
    >>> linopt(ring, refpts=range(5))
