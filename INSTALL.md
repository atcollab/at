AT Installation
---------------

The AT code in this repository evolved from version 1.3 of the original code
and is now maintained by the 'atcollab' collaboration, involving people from
different research institutes.

The latest release can be found [on Github](https://github.com/atcollab/at/releases).

Installation process:

1. Install git on your computer.

2. Download the latest version of AT:
    `$ git clone https://github.com/atcollab/at.git`

        at_installation/atmat; repeat the operation for
        at_installation/atintegrators.
    - Using the startup.m file:
        Insert a line addpath(genpath(at_installation/atmat) and a similar one
        for atintegrators.
    - Temporarily modifying the path by running:
        `>> cd  at_installation/atmat`
        `>> atpath`

4. Compile all mexfunctions:
    `>> atmexall`

5. Update helpfiles:
    `>> atupdateContents`
    You can now use `athelp` to list all main functions.
